# Columbia's CSI Rockets Payload 2025-26: Onboard ML Anomaly Detection

This repository contains all code, documentation, and resources for CSI's Rockets payload project.  
The goal of the project is to run a machine learning model onboard a rocket to detect anomalies in real-time using accelerometer and altitude data.

---

## Project Goals

- Develop a lightweight ML model capable of detecting flight anomalies in real-time.  
- Generate synthetic datasets from OpenRocket simulations to train the model.  
- Deploy the model on embedded hardware within payload size, weight, and power constraints.
- Provide actionable alerts and logged data for post-flight analysis.
